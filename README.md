    Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Meet my interactive portfolio where you can chat with AI to learn about my work. A fun way to explore my projects, skills, and what I'm learning. Come say hi!

## Quick Start

The easiest way to see all available commands is to use the Makefile:

    make help

Main commands:

    make up      # Start all services with hot-reload
    make build   # Rebuild and start services
    make down    # Stop all services
    make logs    # View service logs
    make clean   # Clean up Docker resources
